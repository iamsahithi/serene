Material Required:

Arduino UNO
Fire sensor or Flame sensor (3 Nos)
Servo Motor (SG90)
L293D motor Driver module
Mini DC Submersible Pump
Small Breadboard
Robot chassis with motors (2) and wheels(2) (any type)
A small can
Connecting wires

Concept:
When fire burns it emits a small amount of Infra-red light, this light will be received by the IR receiver on the sensor module. Then we use an Op-Amp to check for change in voltage across the IR Receiver, so that if a fire is detected the output  pin (DO) will give 0V(LOW) and if the is no fire the output pin will be 5V(HIGH).
So, we place three such sensors in three directions of the robot to sense on which direction the fire is burning
