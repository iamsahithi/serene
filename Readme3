One of the most common forms of modulation used in wire and wireless system are QAM system.

Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) has been widely used in adaptive modulation because
of its efficiency in power and bandwidth.

IN this paper a Simulink and MATLABcode-based simulation system is designed, and the details of the simulation is implemented using
AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician channel. Simulation study helps us to visualize Eye-Diagram and
scatterplot both at the transmitter and receiver. Performance analysis is done by comparing the
simulated BER with theoretical plot using BER tool. The BER illustrates the relationship between
power in the transmitted signal in terms of SNR and the resulting BER of the system.

Motivation :
A motivation for the use of quadrature amplitude modulation comes from the fact that a straight
amplitude modulated signal, i.e. double sideband even with a suppressed carrier occupies twice
the bandwidth of the modulating signal. This is very wasteful of the available frequency spectrum.
QAM restores the balance by placing two independent double sideband suppressed carrier signals
in the same spectrum as one ordinary double sideband suppressed carrier signal.
